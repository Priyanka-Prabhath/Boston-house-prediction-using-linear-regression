# Boston-house-prediction-using-linear-regression
*Implementing linear regression from scratch using mini batch gradient decent using numpy vectorizations. It is seen that it performs better than the  sklearn inbuilt  implementation.
*So, we predict the price of the houses based on the available data. We implement a Mini-batch Gradient Descent where we update our model Parameter's based on few batches and we want our gradient to reach the Minimum of our Loss Function.
*Our Custom Linear Regression Model works better than Sklearn In-built Linear Implementation.
